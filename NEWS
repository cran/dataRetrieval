* Updated error-handling for Web service calls. More information is returned when errors happen
* Added some basic processing to Water Quality Portal raw data retrievals. Date columns are returned as Date objects, value columns are numeric, and a column is created from the date/time/timezone columns that is POSIXct.
* Added very generalized NWIS and WQP retrieval functions (getNWISData, getNWISSites, getGeneralWQPData, and whatWQPsites) which allow the user to use any argument available on the Web service platform.


dataRetrieval 1.3.2
===========

* Deprecated getQWData, updated readWQPdata to take either parameter code or characteristic name.
* Changed the name of raw data retrievals to: readNWISqw, getNWISunitData, getNWISdvData, and getWQPqwData (from: readNWISqw, retrieveUnitNWISData, retrieveNWISData, getRawQWData)
* Added NA warning to getDVData function
* Updated mergeReport to allow for Sample data with different measurements taken on the same day


dataRetrieval 1.2.2
===========

* Added getNWISDataAvailability function to find measured parameters and period of record information for a requested station.

* Added constructNWISURL function to get the URL that is used to retrieve the data.

* Added getSampleSTORET function to get STORET data directly in Sample dataframe form.

* Fixed a small leap year bug by changing day of year by making Feb. 29 always 59, and March 1st always 60 (even in non-leap years).

dataRetrieval 1.2.1
