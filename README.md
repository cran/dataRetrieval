`dataRetrieval`
=============

R package for data retrieval of water quality and hydrology data. This package was designed to integrate with the `EGRET` package. Please visit the `EGRET` wiki for more information:
[EGRET Wiki](https://github.com/USGS-R/EGRET/wiki)

## Function Overview


|Information Source | Site Query | Meta Data | Data |
| -------------| -------------| ------------- |:-------------|
|NWIS | `getNWISSites` | `getNWISInfo`* | `getNWISData` |
| | `getNWISDataAvailability` | `getNWISSiteInfo` | `getNWISDaily`* |
| | | `getNWISPcodeInfo` | `getNWISSample`* |
| | | | `getNWISdvData` |
| | | | `getNWISunitData` |
| | | | `getNWISqwData` |
| Water Quality Portal | `getWQPSites` | `getWQPInfo`* | `getWQPSample`* |
| | | | `getWQPqwData` |
| | | | `getWQPData` |
| User-supplied files | | `getUserInfo`* | `getUserDaily`* |
| | | | `getUserSample`* |

`* Designed specifically to provide dataframes suitable for use by the `EGRET` package.

##Package Installation
To install the dataRetrieval package, you must be using R 3.0 or greater and run the following command:

	install.packages("dataRetrieval", 
	  repos=c("http://usgs-r.github.com",
	           "http://cran.us.r-project.org"),
	  dependencies=TRUE)

##Version updates
---------------
###dataRetrieval 1.4.0-in developement
Changed naming convention:



|Original Name | New Name |
| ------------- |:-------------|
|getDVData | getNWISDaily |
|getSampleData  |     getNWISSample |
|getSTORETData* | getWQPSample |
|getSampleDataFromFile | getUserSample |
|getDailyDataFromFile | getUserDaily |
|getMetaData | splits into getNWISInfo and getUserInfo |
|getSiteFileData | getNWISSiteInfo |
|getParameterInfo | getNWISPcodeInfo |
|getDataAvailability | getNWISDataAvailability |
|'retrieve' functions | 'get' |

*Changed WaterML2 rbind fill from plyr function to dplyr. Removed plyr import, added dplyr.
*Removing WaterML2 until fixed.


###dataRetrieval 1.3.3

* Updated getNWISSiteInfo to retrieve multiple site file datasets at once using a vector of siteNumbers as input argument.
* Updated error-handling for Web service calls. More information is returned when errors happen
* Added some basic processing to Water Quality Portal raw data retrievals. Date columns are returned as Date objects, value columns are numeric, and a column is created from the date/time/timezone columns that is POSIXct.
* Added very generalized NWIS and WQP retrieval functions (getNWISData, getNWISSites, getGeneralWQPData, and getWQPSites) which allow the user to use any argument available on the Web service platform.


###dataRetrieval 1.3.2

* Deprecated getQWData, updated getWQPData to take either parameter code or characteristic name.
* Changed the name of raw data retrievals to: getNWISqwData, getNWISunitData, getNWISdvData, and getWQPqwData (from: getNWISqwData, retrieveUnitNWISData, retrieveNWISData, getRawQWData)
* Added NA warning to getDVData function
* Updated mergeReport to allow for Sample data with different measurements taken on the same day


##Sample Workflow

Load data from web services:

	library(dataRetrieval)
	Daily <- getNWISDaily("06934500","00060","1979-10-01","2010-09-30")
	Sample <-getNWISSample("06934500","00631","1970-10-01","2011-09-30")
	INFO <-getNWISInfo("06934500","00631", interactive=FALSE)
	Sample <-mergeReport(Daily, Sample)
