Retrieval functions for USGS and EPA hydrologic and water quality data.

A fairly large overhaul of the functions was done on November 31, 2014. Feedback from initial users was incorporated. For questions, bug reports, and suggestions please create an Issue here:

[dataRetrieval Issues page](https://github.com/USGS-R/dataRetrieval/issues)


## Function Overview

Web service retrieval functions:

|Function | Inputs | Description | 
| -------------| ------------------------|:-------------|
|`readNWISdata` | `...`, service | NWIS data using user-specified queries |
|`readNWISdv` | `Common 3`, parameter code, statCd | NWIS daily data with `Common` query |
|`readNWISqw` | `Common 3`, parameter code, expanded | NWIS water quality data with `Common` query |
|`readNWISuv` | `Common 3`, parameter code | NWIS instantaneous data with `Common` query |
|`readNWISpCode` | parameterCd | NWIS parameter code information |
|`readNWISgwl` | `Common 3` | NWIS groundwater level data with `Common` query |
|`readNWISpeak` | `Common 3` | NWIS peak flow data with `Common` query |
|`readNWISmeas` | `Common 3` | NWIS surface-water measurement data with `Common` query |
|`readNWISrating` | siteNumber, type | NWIS rating table for an active USGS streamgage |
|`readNWISsite` | siteNumber | NWIS site information |
|`whatNWISsites` | `...` | NWIS site search using user-specified queries |
|`whatNWISdata` | siteNumber, service | NWIS data availability, including period of record and count |
|`readWQPdata` | `...` | WQP data using user-specified queries |
|`readWQPqw` | `Common 3` | WQP data with `Common 3` query and either parameter code or characteristic name|
|`whatWQPsites` | `...` | WQP site search using user-specified queries |

* `Common 3` = siteNumber, startDate, endDate

Moving `EGRET` specific functions to `EGRET` (version 2.0.0 and greater):


|Information Source | Meta Data | Data |
| -------------| -------------| ------------- |:-------------|
|NWIS | `getNWISInfo` | `getNWISSample` |
|  |  | `getNWISDaily` |
| Water Quality Portal  | `getWQPInfo`| `getWQPSample` |
| User-supplied files | `getUserInfo` | `getUserDaily`|
| | | `getUserSample` |

##Package Installation
To install the dataRetrieval package, you must be using R 3.0 or greater and run the following command:
```R
	install.packages("dataRetrieval")
```

##Version updates
---------------

###dataRetrieval 2.0.0

* Changing naming convention. Migrated `EGRET` specific retrievals to `EGRET`
* Added back WaterML2 parsing tool
* Added specific groundwater, rating, peak, and surfacewater measurement functions
* Attached metadata attributes to returned dataframes


###dataRetrieval 1.4.0
* Changed naming convention:



###dataRetrieval 1.3.3

* Updated getNWISSiteInfo to retrieve multiple site file datasets at once using a vector of siteNumbers as input argument.
* Updated error-handling for Web service calls. More information is returned when errors happen
* Added some basic processing to Water Quality Portal raw data retrievals. Date columns are returned as Date objects, value columns are numeric, and a column is created from the date/time/timezone columns that is POSIXct.
* Added very generalized NWIS and WQP retrieval functions (getNWISData, getNWISSites, getGeneralWQPData, and whatWQPsites) which allow the user to use any argument available on the Web service platform.


###dataRetrieval 1.3.2

* Deprecated getQWData, updated readWQPdata to take either parameter code or characteristic name.
* Changed the name of raw data retrievals to: readNWISqw, getNWISunitData, getNWISdvData, and getWQPqwData (from: readNWISqw, retrieveUnitNWISData, retrieveNWISData, getRawQWData)
* Added NA warning to getDVData function
* Updated mergeReport to allow for Sample data with different measurements taken on the same day


##Sample Workflow

Load data from web services:
```R
	library(dataRetrieval)
	Daily <- getNWISDaily("06934500","00060","1979-10-01","2010-09-30")
	Sample <-getNWISSample("06934500","00631","1970-10-01","2011-09-30")
	INFO <-getNWISInfo("06934500","00631", interactive=FALSE)
	Sample <-mergeReport(Daily, Sample)
```
